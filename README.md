# Optimising-SCOP
## Basic strcuture 

The file `Updated version` contains the orginal data about charge desities ` updated_charge_densities`, utility functions `utils` and grapical and numerical resulting cross sections`cross_section_figs`.
We model the Spherical Complex Optical Potential (V_st, V_ex, V_pol and V_abs) and fumulate the solution to total (elastic + inelastic) cross sections in `util.py`
The results can be obtain by directly running `cross_section.py` just change the Atom categories for the five different atoms or molecules.
We convert the unit from Hartree to electronVolt using the conversion function `conversions.py`
